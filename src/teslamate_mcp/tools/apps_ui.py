"""MCP Apps extension: interactive charts rendered in-conversation.

Each `AppSpec` binds a bundled query to a self-contained HTML app
(ext-apps spec 2026-01-26) that the host renders in a sandboxed iframe.
Per SEP-2133 every app tool degrades gracefully: it returns the same rows
as its backing `get_*` query tool, so clients that did not negotiate the
Apps extension still get the data.

# ignoring it — so app tools now rely solely on the spec's tool-level
# `_meta.ui.resourceUri` binding. Do not re-add the result-level link.
